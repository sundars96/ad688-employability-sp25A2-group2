**🤖 AI: Job Disruptor and Creator**

AI’s influence on employment is twofold—it both replaces and generates jobs.

According to the World Economic Forum (2024):

🔁 85 million jobs will be displaced by AI by 2025
➕ But 97 million new roles will be created, many of which didn’t exist a decade ago

⚠️ Roles Most at Risk:
🧾 Administrative & Clerical – Data entry clerks, receptionists

🛍️ Retail & Banking – Cashiers, loan officers, bank tellers

🏭 Manufacturing – Machine operators, assembly line staff

**🚀 Emerging AI-Powered Roles:**

🧠 AI/ML Engineers – Developing intelligent algorithms

📊 Data Scientists & Algorithmic Traders – Deriving insights and driving automated decision-making

🎨 AI-Enhanced Creatives – Using AI tools for design, copywriting, and content generation

⚖️ AI Ethics & Policy Analysts – Addressing ethical use and regulation of AI

As AI transforms industries, digital literacy, analytical skills, and creativity will be more important than ever.
