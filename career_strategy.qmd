**2. Optimize Resumes for ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)**

With over 75% of companies using AI-powered ATS systems, making resumes AI-friendly is more important than ever.

Focus on formatting for machine readability, using role-specific keywords, and avoiding over-designed templates.

Tools like Jobscan and Resume Worded can help optimize your resume for higher visibility before submission [@umass2024ats].

**3. Adapt to Hybrid Work Environments**
