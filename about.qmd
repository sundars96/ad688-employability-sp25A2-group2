**Decoding the Job Market: AI vs. Non-AI – Disruption or Opportunity?**
As AI continues to reshape industries, I wanted to explore a question that hits close to home for many of us navigating the job hunt:

**Is AI eliminating traditional jobs—or opening new doors for human talent?**

**📌 Why This Topic?**
Because stepping into the 2025 job market feels like walking into a battlefield—where AI seems to level up faster than the rest of us. So I decided to dive in and analyze the data behind the noise.

**My key questions:**
✅ Is AI replacing or generating jobs?
✅ How do AI vs. Non-AI roles compare in growth and salaries?
✅ What can job seekers do to stay competitive—especially in an AI-dominated hiring process?

**👨‍💻 Who Am I?**
A curious grad student & data enthusiast using Python, web analytics, and a whole lot of hustle to decode what’s really going on in the job market ( Also )

**🚀 Goal: Build a research-backed job strategy that helps real people (like us) thrive in a future shaped by AI.**
