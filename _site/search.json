This suggests that while he may have strong foundational knowledge, there is significant room for development in both technical and soft skills. Improving his data analysis capabilities could enhance his decision-making, while strengthening communication and problem-solving will boost collaboration and efficiency in cross-functional roles.\nüßë‚Äçüíª Krystie‚Äôs Skill Gaps :\nKrystie‚Äôs top developmental areas are well-balanced and revolve around leadership-oriented tasks: Management, Presentations, and Project Management, all with a gap of 3. This points to a need for stronger execution and communication of strategic ideas. Enhancing her presentation skills, in particular, would enable her to convey ideas more convincingly, while project and team management improvements could increase her effectiveness as a future leader.\nüßë‚Äçüíª Nakul‚Äôs Skill Gaps :\nNakul continues to show moderate gaps in Communication and Management (3 each), with a slightly lower gap in Leadership (2). These gaps indicate that his development should focus on articulating ideas clearly and overseeing teams or tasks more effectively. While his leadership gap is lower, refining how he influences and guides others could elevate his contributions in group settings."

    "text": "Introduction\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is accelerating at an unprecedented pace, transforming the global employment landscape and fueling discussions around job displacement, wage differences, and the rise of new career paths. As automation powered by AI integrates into diverse sectors, the workforce is compelled to keep pace with shifting skill requirements. This report examines the rise and implications of AI-driven vs.¬†traditional careers in 2024, offering a detailed look at salary trends, job stability, industry shifts, and emerging professional opportunities.\nResearch Rationale\nThe impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on employment is both disruptive and generative‚Äîeliminating certain roles while simultaneously creating new ones. As highlighted by the World Economic Forum (2024), AI is projected to displace 85 million jobs by 2025, but also give rise to 97 million new opportunities. This profound transformation calls for a data-informed analysis to explore:\nThe distinctions between AI-powered roles and traditional job functions.\nIndustry-specific trends in AI-driven job creation vs.¬†displacement.\nThe most in-demand skills across both AI and Non-AI career paths.\nVariations in salary patterns between emerging and conventional professions.\nThrough a combination of ‚Äúlightcast‚Äù labor data, collaborative GitHub workflows, and Quarto publishing, this study delivers actionable insights to guide job seekers navigating the 2024 workforce.\nLiterature Review\n1. Emergence of New AI-Centric Job Titles\nBrown ((2024)) highlights the rapid evolution of the job market, noting the creation of new AI-driven roles such as Prompt Engineers, AI Ethics Officers, and Automation Specialists. These positions, which didn‚Äôt exist a decade ago, reflect the shifting demands of a technology-driven workforce.\n2. AI‚Äôs Influence on Employment Patterns\nAs observed by Smith ((2023)), sectors like finance, healthcare, and technology have benefited from a rise in AI-powered roles. In contrast, retail, customer service, and manufacturing are increasingly at risk due to automation, leading to potential job displacement.\n3. Compensation Disparities Between AI and Traditional Roles\nJohnson ((2024)) reports that roles in AI‚Äîsuch as Machine Learning Engineers and Data Scientists‚Äîcommand 30‚Äì50% higher salaries than traditional positions like Mechanical Engineers or Accountants. This pay premium is driven by demand for AI skills and the relative security these roles offer in an evolving job market."
