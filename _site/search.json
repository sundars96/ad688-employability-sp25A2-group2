    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction and Research Rationale Why is this topic important? The rapid rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming salary structures across various industries. As AI-driven automation reshapes workforce demands, professionals in technology and AI-related fields see significant salary growth, while others may face wage stagnation. Research suggests that high-skilled workers in non-routine jobs are particularly susceptible to AI-driven automation, but the wage benefits vary across occupations (Ozgul et al. (2024)) . This research aims to explore how AI impacts salaries across disciplines and what factors drive wage disparities in 2024.\nWhat trends make this a crucial area of study in 2024? AI vs. Non-AI Salary Gaps: AI-driven careers, such as data science and machine learning engineering, command high salaries, while traditional roles in customer service and administration may see declining wages due to automation. Studies indicate that AI adoption contributes to labor demand shifts, increasing wages for AI-intensive roles while leading to stagnation in others (Alderucci)\nGeographic Salary Variations: Certain regions, like Silicon Valley and New York, offer higher AI salaries, while emerging AI hubs in Europe and Asia may present different trends. Research shows that developing economies, such as India, face “double vulnerability”—a high concentration of workers in low-skill occupations with greater automation potential and lower AI preparedness, compared to developed economies like the U.S. (ganuthula2025skillbasedlabormarketpolarization?).\nRemote vs. In-Office Pay Differences: The rise of remote work has reshaped salary structures, with some AI professionals earning global-scale wages despite living in lower-cost regions.\nIndustry-Specific Wage Growth: AI adoption has led to salary booms in tech, finance, and healthcare, while manufacturing and retail may face stagnation.\nWhat do you expect to find in your analysis? How salaries differ across AI vs. non-AI careers by comparing compensation trends in AI-driven fields vs. traditional sectors. Regions with the highest-paying jobs in AI and non-AI disciplines, highlighting the influence of location on wages. Remote vs. In-Office Salary Comparisons, exploring whether AI professionals working remotely earn more than their in-office counterparts. Industries with the biggest wage growth in 2024, pinpointing which sectors benefited the most from AI-driven transformations.\n##References Ozgul, P., Fregin, M. C., Stops, M., & Peukert, C. (2024).
